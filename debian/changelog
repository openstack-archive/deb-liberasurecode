liberasurecode (1.0.5-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Adds Breaks: liberasurecode0, Replaces: liberasurecode0. Note that I
    know this shouldn't really be necessary, and that it could be an issue
    for upgrades, but at the same time, I know there's no user of this package
    yet since PyECLib isn't used by Swift & Ceph yet.
